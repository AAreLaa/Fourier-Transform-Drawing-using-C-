###[To build this project, I have used C++ (g++ version 7.3.0), SFML (2.5.1), Python(3.8.8) and used VS Code as IDE. You don't need to deal with the setup for SFML, as everything has been included right here and managed to make it untroubled.] 

###Open this file in VS Code. While in the directory containing this makefile, you will type make or mingw32-make(depends what it is in your compiler) through the terminal and the commands in the makefile will be executed. Make then reads the makefile and creates a dependency tree and takes whatever action is necessary.
